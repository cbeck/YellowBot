This is the YellowBot integration project for LocationMonitor, a UBL project.

Please keep the files for the web app in the web directory. Feel free to organize how you see fit. 

I will add the project requirements as I learn them, but basically the whole project is pretty simple. It consists of four things:

1) Some fairly static HTML pages
2) A simple user signup and management system
3) Acceptance of user payments via the Cybersource gateway
4) Passing on the user data via an API to YellowBot

Once a user signs up, all further interaction is actually on a branded YellowBot page. The API for YellowBot is under the docs folder.

Demo server FTP info:

FTP Username: yellowbot@thirddayweb.com
FTP Server: ftp.thirddayweb.com
FTP Server Port: 21

See me for the pw.

Here is the mysql database setup:

db_name: thirdday_yb
db_user: thirdday_yellow

Again, I will give you the pw.


You can view the site at yellowbot.thirddayweb.com.

Let me know if there are any specific php packages you want installed.
